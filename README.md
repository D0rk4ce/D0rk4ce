# Hi, I'm D0rk4ce ! 👋

I’m an analyst by day and a HomeLab architect by night. I build tools to bridge the gap between "I want this automated" and "It’s actually done." My focus is on making self-hosted systems and home automation standardized, efficient, and bulletproof.

## 💖 Support the Lab
Maintaining these tools and keeping the server rack humming incurs real-world API and electricity costs. If my tools have saved you time or improved your workflow, consider a digital high-five!
